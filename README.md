This is a simple Typing Speed Test made using basic HTML, CSS and Javascript (with no frameworks). Use of node is quite limited but is present. 

In order to run this application, npm needs to be installed as there is basic server side scripting using the [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) package.
If you want to use this code the documentation/guide on cloning can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

After cloning the repo, open any terminal and change the directory to the folder that this repo is stored in.

To run the program, there are two options in the terminal:

1. Use `npm start` as I have assigned this to the starting of the http-server in the default port.

2. Use `http-server` to start the server in the default port.

Feel free to suggest any improvements by creating an issue or creating a pull request.

Enjoy!
